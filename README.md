# Restaurant

I developed a website for the place I worked at. I didnt like the original website they used and wanted to create something different
and offer to the management. Never happened as restaurant is closed permanently due to impact of COVID-19. 

Used theme with Bootstrap and CSS elements as well as vanilla JS and Liquid JS, changed majority of elements 
to accomodate the info and responsiveness, as well as layout. A bit of everything went into project.
